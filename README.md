# 🚀 Company Travel Pattern Analysis

**Analyzing business travel requirements across industries, roles, and locations using Python**

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes corporate travel patterns using synthetic data to uncover insights about:
- Most common travel reasons by industry

- **Travel reason breakdown**: Identify most frequent purposes (client meetings, training, etc.)
- **Flexibility metrics**: Analyze remote/hybrid/in-person distributions
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt to real datasets

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Geospatial** (Folium, Geopy, Plotly)
- **Data** (Synthetic dataset generator included)
- **Visualization** (Plotly, Tableau-ready outputs)

# Note
All data is synthetic and it's not real. I generated it using faker in jupyter notebook.
